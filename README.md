## calendar
The program generates a calendar for the entered year.<br>
Source code you can find [here](https://github.com/ishebarshina/Frontend/tree/main/sandbox-JS/calendar).<br>
See how it works: [link](https://ishebarshina.github.io/Frontend/sandbox-JS/calendar/index.html).<br>
This program made in order to understand how the `EventListener` works and how can I manipulate elements in the `DOM`.<br>
